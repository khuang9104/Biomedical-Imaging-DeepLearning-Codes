# Biomedical-Imaging-DeepLearning-Codes
Utilised and adapted a multimodal ResNet-UNet model in Python (PyTorch) to accept four distinct MRI image types (T1, T1c, T2, FLAIR) as inputs simultaneously and generate three different segmentation components (oedema, enhancing tumour, non-enhancing tumour) as outputs. Coded within the Python environment using the PyTorch framework.
